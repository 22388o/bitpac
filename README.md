# Bitpac
Publicly auditable cooperatives that live on bitcoin

# What is a bitpac?

A bitpac is a publicly auditable cooperative that lives on bitcoin. Anyone can create a bitpac and its members can control some money and vote on how to spend it.

# So is this basically a DAO?

The short answer is yes. The long answer is no. Daos are supposed to be autonomous, which, at least to me, means humans do not control the decisions they make. Eth people have ruined the meaning of dao and turned it into "a smart conract where keyholders vote on how to spend some money." By that definition, yes, a bitpac is a dao. But to me, that's a perversion of the meaning. The only true dao would be a robot: a dao completely controlled by software. If actual *people* get to vote on what happens with the dao's money, then it's not a dao, it's some kind of corporation -- in bitpac's case, a cooperative.

# Why did you make this?

One day I was looking up reasons why altcoins are stupid and I came across this gem: https://forum.sushi.com/t/establish-sushi-legal-defense-fund/11813

Basically there's this ethereum "dao" called sushiswap. They got sued by the SEC. In response they created a proposal to use the funds held by the voters in their "dao" to hire lawyers to defend themselves. The vote passed and the money went to a bunch of lawyers.

I thought that was pretty stupid, but I liked the voting part. People voting on how to spend some money may not be a dao in my opinion, but it's still neat. So I made this tool so that bitcoiners can do something similar. Create a multisig by selecting people's profiles from nostr, pick a threshold of how many votes are needed to move the money, and the result you get is a public page where any keyholder can propose how they'd like to spend the money. Every voter gets to accept or reject that proposal, and voila! It's like what sushiswap did except on bitcoin.

# Todo list

- [ ] Make proposals disappear if enough people reject them
- [ ] Make proposals disappear if too much time goes by
- [ ] Improve the user interface
- [ ] Let people transfer their voting rights to someone else
- [ ] Add more items to this todo list
